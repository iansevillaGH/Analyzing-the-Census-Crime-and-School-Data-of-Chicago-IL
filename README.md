# Analyzing-the-Census-Crime-and-School-Data-of-Chicago-IL
In this project, we simulate working for an organization that strives to improve educational outcomes for children and young people in Chicago. Our tools will be Python, SQL, and IBM Db2 on Cloud. Our job is to analyze the census, crime, and school data for a given neighborhood or district. We will identify causes that impact the enrollment, safety, health, environment ratings of schools. This project was a requirement towards the completion of the course "Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python" by IBM and Coursera.
